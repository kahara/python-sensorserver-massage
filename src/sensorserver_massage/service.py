# NOTE: SimpleService does implicit magic, if you don't want that: inherit from BaseService instead
# NOTE: if you need both REPMixin, REQMixin there is also FullService baseclass you can use instead of SimpleService
# here listed separately for example. REPMixin also does a lot of implicit magick, you might not want to leave
# it here unless you need it and definitely go read on how it works.
# If/when you remove these mixins make sure to do something about the related tests too
